            <b> This is a story of two persons let's call them the little chick üê• and the charming kitten üêà. </b>

                Once upon a time, a little chick üê• and a charming kitten üêà were enjoying the happiest moments of their
                lives. They spent their days together, playing and eating side by side. They were the best of friends
                and
                lovers,
                completely inseparable.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="image">

        </div>
        <div class="tile">
            <p>
                However, one day, the little chick üê• and the charming kitten üêà had a disagreement,
                and the kitten went to bed upset, while the little chick couldn‚Äôt sleep, troubled by thoughts of the
                fight.
                He wondered why he kept making the same mistakes and feared that maybe she no longer wanted to talk to
                him.
                He forgot that the kitten had a hard time expressing her feelings, which only amplified from his fear of
                losing
                her.

        </div>

        <div class="tile">
            <p>

                As he lay in bed, he felt a deep sadness, finding solace only in the thought of the kitten‚Äôs smile.
                Eventually, he drifted off to sleep and dreamed of her. In the dream, she was smiling at him just as she
                always did. He reached out, took her hand, and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I love you! I want you to be mine now
                and
                forever.‚Äù She smiled back, and he woke up feeling elated, as dreams of her always brought him joy.

        <div class="tile">
            <p>

                Determined to make things right, he went to her and expressed how deeply sorry he was for the previous
                night. He promised to always wil try to be better for her. With heartfelt sincerity, he told her, <b>My
                    dear
                    reader please read this and imagine I told you this staring directly to your eyes</b> ‚ÄúI love you,
                my
                beloved kitten üêà, more than anything.‚Äù

                In the end, they married, had children, and lived happily in a beautiful home. Their lives were filled
                with
                joy, and they cherished every moment together. Tasnim, I hope our story can have a similar ending. But
                first, will you forgive me, my love?
